# ðŸ§© Code Playground

This repository contains a collection of small coding experiments, freelance mini-projects, and research notebooks developed during my studies and interviews.

Each script or notebook explores a specific programming concept, algorithm, or library.

## ðŸ§  Notes
- These projects are **independent experiments**, not production code.  
- Useful for demonstrating algorithmic thinking, ML experimentation, and general coding practice.
